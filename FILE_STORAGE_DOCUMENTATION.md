### üìÅ **Local File Management**

- View all stored files with metadata
- Search through stored files
- Download files from local storage
- Delete files from local storage
- File integrity verification

### üìä **Storage Analytics**

- Storage statistics (total files, total size)
- Last sync timestamp
- File metadata tracking
- Storage directory information

### üîç **File Discovery**

## Frontend Usage

### Accessing the File Storage Manager

1. **Navigate to File Storage**: Use the sidebar menu to access "File Storage"
2. **View Storage Stats**: See total files, size, and last sync information
3. **Browse Stored Files**: View all files currently in local storage
4. **Search Files**: Use the search box to find specific files
5. **Server Files Tab**: View files available on the remote server
6. **Sync Operations**: Download individual files or sync all files

### Key Operations

#### Syncing Files

- Click "Sync All Files" to download all files from the server
- Monitor progress with the sync progress indicator
- Files are downloaded with concurrent processing for efficiency

#### Managing Files

- **Download**: Click "Download" to get a file from local storage
- **Delete**: Remove files from local storage (does not affect server)
- **Verify**: Check file integrity using SHA-256 hash verification

#### Server File Management

- Switch to "Server Files" tab to see remote files
- Download individual files to local storage
- Files already in storage are marked with a green checkmark

## Storage Structure

### Local Storage Directory

```
back_end/storage/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.json          # File metadata and tracking
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file1.jpg             # Actual stored files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file2.pdf
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Metadata Format

```json
{
  "files": {
    "filename.jpg": {
      "filename": "filename.jpg",
      "originalName": "filename.jpg",
      "size": 1024000,
      "mimetype": "image/jpeg",
      "downloadedAt": "2025-06-24T10:30:00.000Z",
      "localPath": "/absolute/path/to/storage/filename.jpg",
      "hash": "sha256hash...",
      "url": "https://server.com/files/filename.jpg"
    }
  },
  "lastSync": "2025-06-24T10:30:00.000Z",
  "totalFiles": 1,
  "totalSize": 1024000
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The system uses your existing file server configuration:

```env
# Your existing file server base URL
FILE_SERVER_BASE=https://your-cloudflare-tunnel.trycloudflare.com
```

### Storage Settings

- **Default Storage Location**: `back_end/storage/`
- **Metadata File**: `back_end/storage/metadata.json`
- **Concurrent Downloads**: 3 (configurable)
- **File Hash Algorithm**: SHA-256

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

1. **File server not configured**: Ensure `FILE_SERVER_BASE` is set
2. **File not found**: File may have been deleted from the server
3. **Storage permission issues**: Check write permissions for storage directory
4. **Network timeouts**: Large files may timeout (60s default)
5. **Hash mismatch**: File corruption detected during integrity check

### Recovery Steps

1. **Clear corrupted storage**: Use the "Clear Storage" function
2. **Re-sync files**: Run full sync operation
3. **Individual file recovery**: Download specific files manually
4. **Check server connectivity**: Verify file server is accessible

## Best Practices

### Performance

- Use batch downloads for multiple files
- Set appropriate concurrency levels (2-5 recommended)
- Monitor storage space on your server
- Regular integrity checks for critical files

### Security

- File storage requires authentication
- Files are stored with original permissions
- Hash verification ensures file integrity
- Local files are not publicly accessible

### Maintenance

- Periodic cleanup of unused files
- Monitor storage growth
- Regular sync operations for new files
- Backup metadata.json file

## Troubleshooting

### Sync Issues

1. Check file server connectivity
2. Verify authentication tokens
3. Check storage directory permissions
4. Review network timeouts

### File Access Issues

1. Verify file exists in metadata
2. Check local file permissions
3. Validate file integrity
4. Re-download corrupted files

### Performance Issues

1. Reduce concurrency levels
2. Check available disk space
3. Monitor network bandwidth
4. Implement file size limits
